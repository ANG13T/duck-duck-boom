Duck Duck Boom is a VS Code Extension to import USB Rubber Ducky keystroke injection payloads quickly! 

* Import payloads on Hak5 fast
* Easy payload development on devices such as the USB Rubber Ducky and the Rubber Nugget
* Select many payloads from 10 categories ranging from exfiltration to prank payloads

The extension contains a "Quick Payload Select" option that can be accessed through the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows and Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
Duck Duck Boom retrieves up-to-date payloads from the [usbrubberducky-payloads](https://github.com/hak5/usbrubberducky-payloads) repository from Hak5.

## The USB Rubber Ducky
The USB Rubber Ducky is a flash drive that can type keystroke injection payloads onto a device at seriously fast speeds! Computers detect the USB Rubber ducky as a normal keyboard leaving them vulnerable to keystroke injection attacks. Hak5 has a repository storing payloads for the USB Rubber Ducky submitted by users. Duck Duck Boom provides quick access to payloads stored on the Hak5 USB Rubber Ducky repository. 

### Payloads Information
Payloads for the USB Rubber Ducky are written with a language called Ducky Script. Payloads for the USB Rubber Ducky are sorted into 10 categories (credentials, execution, exfiltration, general, incident response, mobile, phishing, prank, recon, and remote_access). On Duck Duck Boom, the **Quick Select** command lets you view payloads under all of those categories.
